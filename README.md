Project Description
A spooky-fun web app that lets you “track” mythical creatures, ghosts, anime legends, and fictional icons around the world — from Yakshis  to Batman. You can select the character, and we show you where they live.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
we are unable to locate  the hiding  places of our idols or whimsical creatures in this real world.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
we made an exclusive website for finding whimsical and supernatural characters.
